# AngularExpressNodeMongo

## Description

This repository contains a simple javascript fullstack application.
Meaning the co-operation of MongoDB, Express, AngularJS and Node.js.
I.e. the the MEAN stack.

The app has been stripped down to bare minimum.
It is not mean to be a starting point for building of new apps.
There are much better scaffolding options that like angular-fullstack.

This application dot contain unit tests, error handling etc.
It's just demonstrating how the different building bricks play together.
My main point here is to show Express/Angular routing play together and also UI/API separation.
